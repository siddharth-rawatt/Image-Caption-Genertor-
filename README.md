# Image-Caption-Genertor-
In this Python project, I have implemented the caption generator using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long short term memory). The image features are extracted from Xception which is a CNN model trained on the imagenet dataset and then feeded the features into the LSTM model is responsible for generating the image captions
